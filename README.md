# Handwritten Numbers Neural Network
A multi-layer neural network with 2 hidden layers and an output layer to classify handwritten number images in the MNIST dataset.

The hidden layers use a sigmoid function as their activation function. The output layer has a softmax function as its activation function. Gradient descent is also used to implement training the classifier with momentum.

An accuracy of 91.6% has been achieved through tweaking parameters of the network.

The code can be executed using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab but if you would prefer to run it otherwise the following libraries are requirements.
- NumPy
- Jupyter
- Matplotlib
